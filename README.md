# Helix Robot

Helix Robot is an open-source autonomous robot project designed for personal use, with the flexibility to be both controlled manually and operate autonomously. The robot is powered by an Arduino board for its core functionalities, with Python providing AI capabilities for autonomy, and HTML facilitating control via a web interface.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Equipped with sensors and AI algorithms, the robot can move and make decisions on its own.
- **Manual Control**: A web-based interface (HTML) allows users to control the robot manually when needed.
- **Arduino-Powered**: The robot's hardware is programmed using Arduino, ensuring smooth integration with sensors, motors, and other components.
- **AI Integration**: Python is used for more complex decision-making processes, allowing the robot to respond intelligently to its surroundings.

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: The microcontroller platform for controlling the robotâ€™s hardware components such as motors and sensors.
- **HTML**: A web-based interface for remotely controlling the robot.
- **Python**: Used to implement AI models that give the robot the ability to navigate autonomously and make intelligent decisions.

## Future Goals

- Implement more advanced AI algorithms for better decision-making.
- Enhance the web interface for better user experience.
- Expand the project with additional sensors and capabilities for more complex tasks.
